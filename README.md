# birdcageOnStuff
[BirdcageOnStuff](http://ernesto.yuanai.org/en/audioHtml/birdcage.html) is a monoaural tape piece composed with Python, Csound and Audacity. The piece explores distorted harmonic spectra for melodic motives, and cellular automata for texture. Both elements use 47-tone equal temperament.

This repo contains bits and pieces of Python and Csound code used to render the piece. The material rendered with this code was then mixed in Audacity.
